		<p>Hello!  We are Pear Electronics!  We are an extremely original company that is totally not based on any existing corporation. Our cheap electronics have always impressed our customers.  Here at Pear Electronics, we have always put customers over money.  Pear empowers countries, communities, customers and people everywhere to use technology to realize their dreams. Customers trust us to deliver technology solutions that help them do and achieve more, whether theyâ€™re at home, work, school or anywhere in their world. We have donated 80% of all our earnings to different charities because we believe that technology can change the world.  (We haven't made any money yet, but we're breaking this promise if we do.  Who do you think we are?  Good people?? Ha.  <s>We're scamming you.</s>)</p>

		<p>Pear Electronics has always believed that the enviroment comes first, and we have done our part to conserve and protect it.  All of our electronics are made of enviromentally friendly materials.  <a href="aboutelectronics.html">Learn more about our commitment to the enviroment</a>.</p>
		<p>Our company started October 1st, 2019 by two likemided individuals.  We sold quality electronics from day one, but we never made a good profit. We are always trying to improve ourselves and improve our selection of electronics.  We also are too lazy to make up more stuff for our "About Us" page, so we'll leave it here. </p>
